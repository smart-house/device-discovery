## Introduction

During the last years, industrials have been increasingly attracted by the Internet of Things market and its potential value in the next few years. From wearables to smart cities passing by the smart home, the IoT market has been growing at an important pace with millions of IoT devices sold in just 2015.

With the avent of the IoT, people are now interacting with dozens of devices every day such as light bulbs, security cameras, smart watches or connected door locks. At the center of this ecosystem is the smartphone which is considered as the control point by which you are meant to interact with your connected world. However, due to the amount of different companies manufacturing these *things*, there are sometimes as many protocols used to communicate with an ecosystem, and even sometimes different protocols for communicating with different devices manufactured by the same company.

## A heterogenous environment

This heterogeneity of protocols becomes a real challenge for the development and the adoption of connected objects by people, but also for the development of use-cases making the whole point of the Internet of Things interesting and truely worth it.

In the old days, when people wanted to equip their house with so called smart devices, they had to request a specialized company to install a whole bunch of expensive equipment, sometimes involving heavy modification of the house itself. They would usually select a *pack* of services to install and the same manufacturer managed to provide and install it.

Today, the business model associated with the smart house has tremendously changed in the sense that you can know buy such devices at the supermarket for a reasonable price, and you can buy them *separately*, meaning that you can perfectly buy a connected light bulb from one manufacturer and second one from another manufacturer.

The problem arises when you want to control them and get a unified view of your home status. Because these devices are provided by two different manufacturers, they are probably not talking the same language, and they do not know each other. This makes it difficult to efficiently control them, probably requiring you to switch between different applications on your smartphone. Imagine that you want to change the dimming of your living room and have light bulbs bought from two or even three different companies, would you like to switch between as many applications with as many different user experiences and ways of doing things to do so ?

Companies do compete with each others, and this competition is usually good for customers, however in this field, it can cause various problems putting its adoption at risk.

## Standards, oh standards !

To solve this issue, standardization consortiums directed by industry leaders and aiming to define a unified way of communication for all these different devices have been created. The problem is that as many different companies were competing against each others using different communication means, the sames happened with different communication standards competing against each others.

To give an overview of the existing standards aiming to rule the IoT market I've listed the main ones below :

## Automation is the way

A common issue I've encountered while equipping my own house with different devices is that they were too much dependent on the smartphone companion application they usually came with. This was causing me to take out my phone, make sure it was connected to my LAN, looking for the appropriate application, waiting for it to connect to my devices, and that each time I wanted to interact with them. Imagine the time taken for turning your shiny new smart light bulb on when coming home where pressing your mural switch takes you approximately on second. Ironic isn't it ?
